## 상황

- 현재 DB open 상태
- 실제 redolog 확인 => 3개 group, 2개 member씩 구성
- 물리적으로 inactive인 log member  삭제
- alert 관찰
- 몇 번의 log switch 발생
- 해결 ? system down 가능

## 시나리오

1. tail follow alert
2. backup
   1. pfile 백업
   2. spfile 기반 pfile 생성
3. select log file where status = `INACTIVE`
4. remove physical member
5. switch logfile
6. result

## 구현

- [x] tail follow alert
  ```shell
  tail -f /oracle12/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/db1/db1/trace/alert_db1.log
  ```

- [x] backup

  - [x] pfile 백업
    ```shell
    cd ${ORACLE_HOME}/dbs
    cp initdb1.ora initdb1.ora.back_$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S")
    cp spfiledb1.ora spfiledb1.ora.back_$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S")
    ```

  - [x] spfile 기반 pfile 생성
    ```sql
    create pfile from spfile;
    ```

- [x] select log file where status = `INACTIVE`
  ```sql
  select a.group#,
         a.member,
         b.bytes/1024/1024 MB,
         b.archived,
         b.status
    from v$logfile a,
         v$log b
   where a.group# = b.group#
     and b.status = 'INACTIVE'
   order by 1, 2;
   
       GROUP# MEMBER                                               MB ARC STATUS
  ---------- --------------------------------------------- ---------- --- ----------------
           1 /home/oracle/oradata/db1/redo01_2.log                200 NO  INACTIVE
           1 /oracle12/app/oracle/oradata/db1/redo01.log          200 NO  INACTIVE
           3 /home/oracle/oradata/db1/redo03_2.log                200 NO  INACTIVE
           3 /oracle12/app/oracle/oradata/db1/redo03.log          200 NO  INACTIVE
  ```

- [x] remove physical member

  ```shell
  rm /home/oracle/oradata/db1/redo03_2.log
  ```

- [x] switch logfile
  ```sql
  alter system switch logfile;
  ```

- [x] subscribe trace file
  ```shell
  ...
  ```

- [x] result
  ```
